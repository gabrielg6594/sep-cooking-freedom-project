            <li>Cooking is not just making food it is the experience of learning and experimenting.</li>
            <li>Skills: People learn to improvise on things quickly for the timeframe that they have, so if they have half an hour to make a meal that has different foods they would try to make all the things at the same pace so it is all ready by the time that they would want it to be finished. Another skill that people would practice to improve their cooking is to make their meals perfect or as good as they are able to be made.
</li>
            <li>Tools: There are many tools for cooking, it entirely depends on the meal or food that the person is making and off of that it will depend if they would use certain tools or not.</li>
            <li>Experiences: People gain knowledge and experience while experimenting while cooking so they could try out different seasonings to see which is the best for which occasion or for which person’s personnel preference.</li>

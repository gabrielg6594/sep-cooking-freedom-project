            <li class="list-group-item">Cooking is not just making food it is the experience of learning and experimenting.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Skills: People learn to improvise on things quickly for the timeframe that they have, so if they have half an hour to make a meal that has different foods they would try to make all the things at the same pace so it is all ready by the time that they would want it to be finished. Another skill that people would practice to improve their cooking is to make their meals perfect or as good as they are able to be made.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Tools: There are many tools for cooking, it entirely depends on the meal or food that the person is making and off of that it will depend if they would use certain tools or not.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Experiences: People gain knowledge and experience while experimenting while cooking so they could try out different seasonings to see which is the best for which occasion or for which personâ€™s personnel preference.</li>

        <p>In the new age of cooking there are many new inventions that help with cooking one of them is called the instapot. It can cook rice, pressure cook, slow cook, steaming, and warming all in one so based on its functions you can see how much it can help people in the kitchen. The most useful thing that the instapot can be used fro and is used for it to slow cook and steaming so instead of you constantly having to watch your food using a different appliance you can have the instant pot cook it for you in a certain way so you don't have to worry about it too much as you would with other cooking appliances. Another useful invention that was made to help with cooking is the Sous Vide it cooks vacuum sealed bags of food in a temperature controlled water to get the best flavors out of the food, so this invention helps everyday people by they could just have a timer and a certain temperature to make the food taste the best in the end.
One new invention that could be made later on would be a stove or oven that would stay at a temperature to cook whatever it is cooking and it would be on a timer and it would shut off right after the timer is up so people don't have to constantly worry and watch the food the entire time and it would be useful for restaurants for example the chefs could have the food being cooked and when the timer is up he will know and then he can take the food out instead of always having to check on it.
